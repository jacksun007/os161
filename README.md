os161
=====

The purpose of this repository to keep a copy of the latest starter code for 
os-161, presumably for the ece344 course offered by University of Toronto. We 
continue to make changes to the start code to make it easier for students to
start and test their implementation.

updates
-------

* added OPT_BADSYNCH to aid with output synchronization during asst0
* added btree and console to testbin
* make git-zip will create a tar.gz file of this repository
* updated multiply to take more than 2 arguments
* added addexec, draw, factsum, and vectormult to testbin
* improved make process so depend.mk does not need to be checked into repository.
